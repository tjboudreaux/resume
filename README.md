## Summary

I’m a seasoned software engineering leader who&#x27;s obsessed with user experience. 
 
I&#x27;ve been an individual contributor in both onsite and remote roles, a team lead, and a product and engineering leader responsible for building multiple agile teams. I’ve worked for startups, small design boutiques, and large corporations and thrived in each environment. 
 
I believe in automation, agile methodologies, DRY principles, data driven feature development, and pragmatic minimalism.
